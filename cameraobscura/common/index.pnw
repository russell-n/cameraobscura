Common Code
===========

<<name='imports', echo=False>>=
# this package
from theape.infrastructure.indexbuilder import create_toctree
@

This is a place for code shared by other code but that isn't used directly by the users. I'm not sure if this should really be separate, but I don't thing these things are utilities. Perhaps the `utilities` are really `common`.

<<name='toctree', echo=False, results='sphinx'>>=
create_toctree()
